In this demo we have created a visual interface that the user can interact with to launch
the minigames and spin the final prize board. You are also able to save a player, load a previous player and see a collection of highscores.
Unit tests are included within the Demo 3 folder, in a subfolder named Test files. These unit tests must be moved to the main path of the program and run individually. Please note junit is required to run the unit tests.
