Interative Demo 
--------
In this final demo we have created a complete visual interface that the user can interact with to launch
the minigames(brickbreaker, snake, plinko) and spin the final prize board. You are also able to save a player and load a previous player as well.

There is also a text based version of the game and it can be found under the InterativeDemo folder. The files are named BoardText, MainText and MiniGameText. 

Unit tests are included within the InterativeDemo folder, in a subfolder named Test files. These unit tests must be moved to the main path of the program and run individually. Please note junit is required to run the unit tests.
